"IF2","To stop traveling in one direction, you need to apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction. Newton's 1st Law!","Newton's 1st Law can help us here, because we know that in order to stop heading in one direction, we need to apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction.","You have to boost in the opposite direction than the one you're heading in if you don't want to keep going in your original direction. Newton's 1st Law is all about this.","Looks like you meant to stop us from going in that direction. How could you have done this?","Newton's 1st Law: We should have boosted a little more in the opposite direction than we were originally heading.","Great job! If we want to stop motion in one direction, we have to apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction. That's all part of Newton's 1st Law.","We should have boosted a little less in the opposite direction. Then we would have stopped. ","You're on the right track, but I don't think boosting less would have stopped us. ","We must have accidentally launched a Fuzzy. Oops!","Nope, no accidental fuzzy launches here! Think about Newton's 1st Law. What happens when unbalanced forces act on the ship?","Maybe if I hadn't boosted at all, I would have come to a stop.","Not quite. In order to slow down or stop, there needs to be an unbalanced force acting in the opposite direction. That's what Newton's 1st Law is all about."
"IF4","Pay attention to Newton's 3rd Law. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The launch of the Fuzzy needs to be taken into account","We changed direction because you launched that Fuzzy pod! An equal-and-opposite force acted on our ship when we launched it. This is Newton's 3rd Law.","Launching Fuzzies affects the movement of our ship; if we launch a fuzzy in one direction, our ship will move in the opposite direction because of the 3rd Law.","How come we didn't stay on course?","Newton's 3rd Law: We launched the Fuzzy, which caused an equal-and-opposite force to be applied to our ship. ","You're right! Newton's 3rd Law says that if we launch a fuzzy in one direction, our ship will move in the opposite direction. ","Balanced forces were applied to the ship, so there was no change in motion due to Newton's 1st Law.","No, I don't think we had balanced forces here. Balanced forces don't change our velocity (speed and direction).","2nd Law: We applied too big of a boost and it resulted in too much acceleration.","No, try again. What happened during the fuzzy launch? Were there any other forces acting on the ship during the launch?","Some outside force must have acted on the ship. It wasn't because of that Fuzzy pod launching.","I don't think there were any other outside forces here. Think about the forces that acted on the ship during the launch."
"IF6","Launching a Fuzzy changes the ship's motion by applying an equal-and-opposite force on the ship. That's Newton's 3rd Law in action!","The 3rd Law would help here. The motion of the ship will change when the equal-and-opposite force from the Fuzzy launch acts on the ship.","The equal-and-opposite force on the ship caused by launching a Fuzzy sent us off course! Isn't physics interesting? Remember the 3rd Law!","You launched the Fuzzy and went off course! What law explains why?","3rd Law:  Launching Fuzzies in one direction changes our motion in the opposite direction. I remember this now.","You're right! The equal-and-opposite force from the fuzzy launch caused the ship to move off course.","2nd Law: Our ship's acceleration changes when the mass changes. This has got to be the key to what just happened.","The 2nd Law is not what we need here. Think about the forces acting on the ship during the fuzzy launch.","Launching a Fuzzy should have no effect on our movement. Something fishy's going on.","Nope, nothing fishy. Think about the forces acting on the ship during the fuzzy launch. Were there any unbalanced forces that could have changed the ship's motion?","Newton's 1st Law, right here! We continued to stay in motion because no forces acted on us!","That's a great law, but not the one we need here. Think about the unbalanced force that acted on the ship during the fuzzy launch."
"IF7","We should keep in mind that our ship could start moving and go off course when we apply unbalanced forces to it. That's what Newton's 1st Law says.","1st Law: Objects in motion stay in motion unless an unbalanced force acts on them! The ship moved off course because of that boost.","Velocity is speed with a direction. The ship is going to change its velocity if an unbalanced force is applied.","We started moving in the wrong direction! Why?","Thanks to Newton's 1st Law, our ship changes its velocity (speed and direction) if an unbalanced force acts on it. In this case, the thrusters created the unbalanced force.","Great answer! The unbalanced force from the thrusters changed our velocity and we went off course.","According to Newton's 1st Law, we went in the wrong direction because we ran into space debris, which knocked us off course.","I don't think that space debris is responsible for this one. Think about what effect the thrusters have on the ship.","We must have accidentally launched a Fuzzy. Oops!","Nope, no accidental fuzzy launches here! Think about what happens when unbalanced forces act on the ship.","Newton's 3rd Law: Colliding with an obstacle rebounds us on a new path with the same speed.","Good try, but that's not what caused us to move off course. Think about what happens when unbalanced forces from our thrusters act on the ship."
"IF8","Newton's 1st Law of Motion tells us that an object in motion will stay in motion unless an unbalanced force acts on it!","Our velocity (speed and direction) won't change unless an unbalanced force acts on us - Newton's 1st Law!","We have to use the 1st Law to stop our ship. An object in motion tends to stay in motion, after all. No wonder we went off course.","We missed our mark! Why?","Newton's 1st Law! Objects in motion will stay in motion unless an unbalanced force acts on them. In this case, our ship just kept going!","You're right! Our velocity (speed and direction) won't change unless an unbalanced force acts on us. Newton's 1st Law!","For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction! Newton's 3rd Law applies here.","Hmmm... No. The 3rd Law generally applies when one thing launches the other, or when two things collide or push on each other. None of those things happened here.","The ship isn't heavy enough to slow down in space. That's why we kept going.","Good thought, but the only way the ship can slow down is if there is an unbalanced force in the opposite direction that the one its traveling in.","The ship's boosters must be broken, honest!","Nope, the boosters are working just fine. What happens when there is no unbalanced force to slow the ship down?"
"IF9","You know, an equal force in the opposite direction we're heading could slow down, stop, or even reverse our ship. Otherwise, we'll just keep going and going.","Newton's 1st Law says objects don't stop unless unbalanced forces act on them in the opposite direction of the one they're heading in. ","Hey now, remember Newton's 1st Law. We won't stop unless an unbalanced force pushes on the ship in the opposite direction of the one we're heading in!","The ship overshot the planned trajectory! According to the 1st Law, what could've helped us in time?","We should have applied an unbalanced force in the opposite direction of the one we're heading in. ","Right! An unbalanced force could have stopped the ship. That's part of Newton's 1st Law.","Launching a Fuzzy behind us could have stopped us.","Not quite. Launching a fuzzy behind us would have actually caused the ship to speed up! That's not what we want!","If we had balanced forces on either side of the ship, it might have helped us out here.","Well, balanced forces don't cause any changes to the ship's motion. That's part of Newton's 1st law. We need an unbalanced force in the opposite direction to slow it down.","The ship is much too heavy. No wonder we had this problem.","No. Even really big ships can be stopped in space with unbalanced forces. Try again."
"IF10","Listen up! Newton's 1st Law tells us that an unbalanced boost applied to our ship will cause us to change velocity. Velocity is speed with a direction.","Newton's 1st Law says that boosts applied perpendicular to the direction we're moving will send us off on a new trajectory. 'Perpendicular' means sideways to the direction we're traveling.","Don't forget the 1st Law: The ship will alter its trajectory if an unbalanced force (such as from boosting) acts on it. Get it?","Ack! We went off course! How could this happen?","1st Law: A boost was applied and changed the direction of the ship's travel.","Yes! When a boost is applied perpendicular to the ship's motion, it causes the ship to change direction. 'Perpendicular' means sideways to the direction we are moving.","Newton's 1st Law, of course: An unbalanced force in the opposite direction of our motion caused us to stop.","Well, we didn't really stop here. We just went off course after that boost. What happened?","I know this is because of the 2nd Law. We increased our mass so we needed more force to accelerate. ","It's true that the 2nd Law shows that more mass needs more force to accelerate, but our mass didn't change.","We hit something and it sent us on a new path with the same velocity. Newton's 3rd Law!","As part of the third law says: A collision could change our course because of the 'equal and opposite reaction.' But, there was no collision!"
"IF11","You boosted and changed your course, leading to a Newton's 1st Law situation. Make sure to take all forces into account!","We changed direction because of the force from the boost. All unbalanced forces that act on the ship can alter its direction. That's the 1st Law!","Remember that Newton's 1st Law talks about what happens when different forces cause us to move. A perpendicular force made your ship move diagonally.","That's an interesting change of direction you did there - what do you think is going on?","We obviously moved the wrong way because of Newton's 1st Law. Combined forces lead to interesting paths!","Yep! Combined forces can make you travel in diagonal paths.","If I'm correct, applying an unbalanced force in the opposite direction of our motion stops us, according to Newton's 1st Law.","I don't think that's what we need here. You didn't stop--you changed direction. What made you change direction?","Our ship is much too heavy, which is why we keep going off course.","No, the ship's weight doesn't affect its direction. What happened to make the ship start traveling in the wrong direction?","Whoa! We rebounded off a space object, and it sent us flying in a new direction. That's what Newton's 3rd Law deals with.","Nope, not this time. I think you need another one of Newton's Laws."
"IF12","Your direction changed in accordance with Newton's 1st Law. An unbalanced force moved you in the wrong direction.","Don't forget that every time you boost, a new force is applied to the ship. Newton's 1st Law says that unbalanced forces change your velocity. Velocity is speed and direction.","Boosts apply forces to the ship. Think about Newton's 1st Law. It's all about changes to your velocity (speed and direction).","Hey, the ship wasn't supposed to go that way! What happened?","Newton's 1st Law of course. The unbalanced force from the boost changed our velocity.","Yep! An unbalanced force will always change the velocity of the ship. Velocity means speed AND direction.","The last boost I did wasn't very strong. It shouldn't have affected our velocity. The problem must be something else.","Even small unbalanced forces change your velocity. That's what Newton's 1st Law says.","Newton's 2nd Law: A gravitational force acted on the ship and caused it to accelerate off course. ","No, I think the acceleration may have come from that last boost. What happens when you apply a boost perpendicular to the direction of motion? Perpendicular means sideways to the direction you are moving.","3rd Law: The ship hit another space object. That made it go off course in a new direction. Not good!","No, I don't think a space object is responsible for knocking us off course. Think about what happened to the ship's motion when you used that last boost."
"IF14","Newton's 3rd Law tells us that every action has an equal-and-opposite reaction. When you apply a force to launch a Fuzzy, the Fuzzy applies an equal-and-opposite force back on you.","When you launch a Fuzzy, be prepared to go off course! Launching a Fuzzy applies an equal-and-opposite force on the ship in the direction opposite of the Fuzzy launch. 3rd Law. Now we know.","Launching the fuzzy applied an equal force on our ship in the opposite direction. Newton's 3rd Law sent us off course!","Why did the ship go in the wrong direction just now? I thought we planned better!","Launching the Fuzzy applied an equal force on our ship in the opposite direction of the Fuzzy launch. Newton's 3rd Law sent us off course!","Right on! When we applied a force on the Fuzzy to launch it, the Fuzzy applied an equal-and-opposite force on our ship!","Newton's 3rd Law: The Fuzzy was launched behind us causing us to change direction.","Well, not quite. Launching a Fuzzy behind us would have caused the ship to speed up but not change direction. That's not what happened!","Launching Fuzzies only affects the Fuzzy pod itself, not our ship! ","Nice try, but according to Newton's 3rd law, there's an equal-and-opposite force acting on the ship during the fuzzy launch. ","A decrease in mass caused the ship to accelerate, which is directly related to the 2rd Law.","Well, not quite. Changing mass is related to Newton's 2nd Law, but an unbalanced force made us change our direction. What unbalanced force acted on the ship during the launch?"
"IF16","Apparently we changed direction because of the Fuzzy launch, just like the 3rd Law predicts.","Launching the Fuzzy applied an equal-and-opposite force on our ship. That's the 3rd Law.","Newton's 3rd Law sure applies here. We would have been okay, but the equal-and-opposite force from the Fuzzy launch knocked us off course.","Uh oh, that Fuzzy launch sent us flying off course. Could you remind me again why this happens?","Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Launching the Fuzzy applies an equal-and-opposite force on our ship.","Yep, you got it. That reaction force from the launch changed our direction. Newton's 3rd Law.","We should have launched the fuzzy behind us to make our ship go at an angle.","No, a fuzzy launched behind us would have speeded up the ship, NOT changed its direction. ","The 1st Law: A stationary object will not move unless a force acts on it.","That is a true statement, but it doesn't apply here.","I'm pretty sure Newton's 1st Law is to blame, because there were no unbalanced forces acting on the ship at the time.","No. There had to be an unbalanced force on the ship. Otherwise, we wouldn't have changed our speed or direction.Where could the unbalanced force have come from? "
"IF17","When two objects collide, the 3rd Law is in effect. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, which you can see when you bounce off the wall.","Newton's 3rd Law of Motion tells us that after colliding with an obstacle, objects rebound on a new trajectory with the same velocity.","When this ship hits a Collision Wall, it rebounds on a new trajectory with the same velocity. Newton's 3rd Law explains it all.","Which part of Newton's Laws explains why your ship bounced the way it did off the Collision Wall?","The 3rd Law. If you collide with an obstacle, you will rebound on a new trajectory with the same velocity.","You got it! That collision changed your direction of motion because of the equal and opposite force applied by the obstacle to the ship.","The 3rd Law: Throwing a fuzzy forward can cause the ship to move backward.","I don't think that will help us here since you didn't launch any fuzzies. Did colliding with the wall affect your direction?","The 1st Law: A stationary object will not move unless an unbalanced force acts on it.","The 1st Law isn't going to help us here. Can you think of another law that you can use?","The 2nd Law: For a constant force, acceleration decreases when mass increases.","I don't think that's going to be useful here because the 2nd Law deals with force, mass and acceleration. Is there another law you can use? "
"IF18","If the ship hits a wall, it bounces off at the same angle it hit with! Newton's 3rd Law. The collision causes an equal and opposite force to be applied to the ship.","The ship bounces away from the wall at the same angle that it hit the wall. Newton's 3rd Law: Equal and opposite reaction.","Check it out! The ship's path after colliding with the wall mirrors its path before the collision. That's because of the 3rd law.","Oh my, our bounce off that wall sent us flying! How is an object supposed to move if it rebounds off a wall?","It rebounds away at the same angle it approached the wall with. Newton's 3rd law explains it. Equal and opposite reaction.","You got it! The collision causes an equal and opposite force to be applied to the ship. The ship's path after colliding with the wall is a mirrored version of its path before the collision. ","We should stop moving because the force of hitting the wall is in the opposite direction of the ship's motion.","No, the force of an elastic collision doesn't stop the ship or change its speed. It only makes the ship change direction.","It rebounds in the same exact direction it came from. It doesn't really change it's direction at all.","Nope, not quite. If it is an elastic collision, it keeps the same speed, but it changes direction.","It flies off in a random direction and at a slower speed.","Nice try, but that's not quite how it works. Collisions change the direction of the ship but not the speed if the collision is elastic."
"IF19","Newton's 3rd Law. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So when you hit a wall, remember that you will bounce off in the opposite direction!","Newton's 3rd Law: The collision causes an equal and opposite force to be applied to the ship. The angle you hit the wall therefore determines the angle you leave the wall. ","Your path after hitting the wall mirrors your path before hitting the wall. Newton's 3rd Law: Every action causes an equal and opposite reaction.","What determines which direction the ship will go after it collides with a wall?","The ship rebounds away at the same angle it hit the wall with. Newton's 3rd Law. Every action causes an equal and opposite reaction.","Yes! For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So when you hit a wall, the wall applies an equal and opposite force on the ship.","The speed of the ship before it hit the wall.","Try again. The ship's speed doesn't change during this collision. This is an elastic collision.","The mass of the ship.","Try again. The mass of the ship doesn't affect the direction it rebounds.","Nothing determines the direction: it is always random.","No, there's nothing random about the ship's motion! The ship always obeys Newton's Laws. Is there a law that helps you understand collisions?"
"IF22","Looks like you'll have to stay farther away from those fields. Newton's 1st Law: Apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction to avoid them.","The ship isn't equipped to handle such heat! Let's try avoiding radiation fields next time, alright? Newton's 1st Law: Apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction to avoid them.","Yes, radiation fields are very pretty but please, don't touch them! Newton's 1st Law: Apply an unbalanced force in the opposite direction to avoid them.","Ack, you ran into a Radiation Field! According to the 1st Law, what could've helped you stop the ship in time?","Applying an unbalanced force in the opposite direction of the one we're heading in.","Bingo! An unbalanced force in the opposite direction can stop you! That is part of Newton's 1st Law.","We could have launched a Fuzzy behind us.","No, launching a fuzzy behind us would have caused us to speed up. What else can you use to stop the ship?","Applying balanced forces on either side of the ship.","No, remember that balanced forces don't change the motion of the ship at all. That's also part of Newton's 1st Law.","I think we have too much mass. The ship's weight is creating issues.","Keep trying! The mass of the ship doesn't matter here. Even heavy ships can be stopped using Newton's 1st Law."
"IF23","You need to activate a shield to go through an asteroid belt.","Asteroids tend to destroy things that run into them. Let's be more careful! You need to use your shield.","Watch out! Oh, wait, too late. You should have activated a shield before hitting that asteroid.","Your ship ran into an Asteroid! You need to use a shield. If you don't have a shield, though, how could you stop the ship in time?","An unbalanced force in the opposite direction could have stopped us. That's part of Newton's 1st Law. ","Fantastic! An unbalanced force in the opposite direction can stop you!","Launching a Fuzzy behind us could have stopped us.","No, that would have caused you to speed up. What else can you use to stop the ship?","Applying balanced forces on either side of the ship.","No, remember that balanced forces don't change the motion of the ship at all. That's also part of Newton's 1st Law.","If we increase our mass somehow, maybe we wouldn't hit the asteroid.","Keep trying! The mass of the ship doesn't matter here. Newton's 1st Law works the same here no matter how heavy the ship is."
"IF25","We have two choices here. Either wear a disguise or go around the Prickly ship using Newton's 1st Law to change your direction.","If you don't have a disguise, you need to go around enemy Pricklies. Apply an unbalanced force to stop or change your direction. That's part of Newton's 1st Law.","No, not the Pricklies! We can't let them win. Wear a disguise next time and they won't even know we're here.","Your ship got destroyed by a Prickly! You either need a disguise or you need to stop or change direction. According to the 1st Law, how could you stop or change direction in time?","Newton's 1st Law: Applying an unbalanced force in the opposite direction could have stopped us or changed our direction.","Way to go! An unbalanced force in the opposite direction can stop you or change your direction!","Shooting a Fuzzy behind us could have stopped us.","No, that would have caused you to speed up. What else can you use to stop the ship?","Applying balanced forces on either side of the ship.","No, remember that balanced forces don't change the motion of the ship at all. That's also part of Newton's 1st Law.","The ship isn't heavy enough! It needs more mass!","Keep trying! The mass of the ship doesn't matter here. Newton's 1st Law works the same here no matter how heavy the ship is."
"IF26","The ship isn't meant to handle such harsh, caustic nebulae. You can change direction with an unbalanced force. That is part of Newton's 1st Law.","Aaaaah, my eyes! You should have stopped the ship or changed direction by applying an unbalanced force. That's part of Newton's 1st Law.","Only Fuzzy pods can go through that stuff. You need to go around it by applying unbalanced forces to change your direction. Newton's 1st Law.","You've been destroyed by a Caustic Nebula! According to the 1st Law, how could you stop or change direction?","Maybe we should have applied an unbalanced force in the opposite direction. ","Yep, you got it! An unbalanced force in the opposite direction would have worked. That is part of Newton's 1st Law.","Launching a Fuzzy behind the ship could have stopped us.","No, that would have caused you to speed up. What else can you use to stop the ship?","Applying balanced forces on either side of the ship.","No, remember that balanced forces don't change the motion of the ship at all. That's also part of Newton's 1st Law.","Too bad our mass isn't correct--maybe we should have changed it at the last minute to not hit the nebula.","Not quite. The mass of the ship doesn't matter here. Newton's 1st Law works the same here no matter how heavy the ship is."
"IF27","The ship's hull is weak enough to get damaged by collisions. Next time you need to activate your shield.","It's probably best if we don't hit those walls! We can stop, go a different way, or use a shield.","Too bad there was no shield during the moment you hit that wall. The poor ship needs protection!","You were destroyed by a Collision Wall! According to the 1st Law, what could've helped you stop the ship in time before getting too close to it?","I think an unbalanced force in the opposite direction would've done the trick.","Bingo! An unbalanced force in the opposite direction would have worked.","We could have thrown a Fuzzy behind us in the opposite direction of the ship's travel.","No, that would have caused you to speed up. What else can you use to stop the ship?","Balanced forces on either side of the ship would be enough to slow us to a stop.","No, remember that balanced forces don't change the motion of the ship at all. That's also part of Newton's 1st Law.","Our ship is way too light. We need to be heavier so we won't get hurt from the Collision Wall.","Not quite. The mass of the ship doesn't matter here. Newton's 1st Law works the same here no matter how heavy the ship is."
"IF28","Remember to put a shield on while bouncing off a Collision Wall. Accidents happen!","Those walls hurt if we collide with them. It would be wise to activate a shield when we run into them.","Always put a shield around the ship if you want to collide with walls!","That Collision Wall destroyed the ship. What could have prevented this?","We should have activated our shields at the proper moment.","That's right! You need a shield or you need to avoid the wall.","We hit the Wall way too hard. Next time, we'll fly slower.","No. Speed doesn't matter. You need a shield or you need to avoid the wall.","There must be some mistake, we barely touched the wall!","That doesn't matter. You need a shield if you touch it at all.","Next time we need to boost at the same time we hit the wall to protect the ship.","Nope. You need a shield or you need to avoid the wall."
"IF29","Time of arrival, speed of arrival, and angle of arrival at the exit portal don't matter. You need to have a waypoint each place you have an impulse or Fuzzy Launch. You can't have any waypoints without an impulse or a Fuzzy launch.","You need to have a waypoint at each place you have an impulse or Fuzzy Launch. You can't have any waypoints without an impulse or a Fuzzy launch. Check your whole line. You might want to redraw any parts of the line that overlap.","Check for a waypoint where you don't have an impulse or launch. (Make sure you didn't accidently put an extra waypoint on a switch if there is one – you can't see waypoints behind switches. You only need waypoints where you have impulses or launches.","Which of these reasons can cause a mission failure even when you reach the open exit portal and stay on your line?","Reasons 1 and 2 can cause a mission failure even if you stay on your line and reach the open exit portal.","That is correct. You need to have a waypoint each place you have an impulse or Fuzzy Launch. You can't have any waypoints without an impulse or a Fuzzy launch. Check your whole line. You might want to redraw any parts of the line that overlap.","Reason 1: Impulses and launches in your timeline need to happen at waypoints. You might need to add a waypoint along one of your lines.","True. You need to have a waypoint on your line each place you have an impulse or Fuzzy launch. But what else?","Reason 2: Every waypoint needs at least one impulse or launch. You might need to delete an extra waypoint where you don't have an impulse or launch.","True. You can't have a waypoint where you don't have an impulse or launch. But what else? (Make sure you didn't accidently put an extra waypoint on a switch if there is one – you can't see waypoints behind switches. You only need waypoints where you have impulses or launches.)","Reason 3: I ran out of time or travelled too fast or arrived at the wrong angle.","False. Time of arrival, speed of arrival, and angle of arrival at the exit portal don't matter."
"IF30","Look out for the laser beam! Oh wait, too late... ","I think that button over there does something with the laser. Try pushing it. ","Lasers have to be turned off before you try and go through them! ","Ack! How could you have avoided getting hurt by the laser beam? ","I could have stopped my ship over the laser button using an equal amount of force in the opposite direction of my motion.","Correct! Those buttons turn off the laser beams.","I could've increased my velocity to speed through the laser beam and not get hurt.","Unfortunately, that's not how the lasers work. You can't pass through them.","If I could somehow use force over time to accelerate my ship, maybe I could make it through the beam.","I see what you mean, but something tells me that's not going to work.","The beam might not hurt me if I had more mass! I could pick up a Fuzzy pod to increase my mass.","The laser beam will destroy you no matter how much mass you have. Sorry Surge!"
"IF31","Your velocity wasn't quite right. Make sure it matches the sign on the gate. ","Oh no, you didn't make it! I think you have to have the same velocity that's written on the sign. ","These gates are tricky. Try changing up your speed so you can pass safely. ","I have some ideas on how to change your velocity, but I think one of them is wrong. Can you help me out?","You could apply balanced forces to either side of the ship.","Really? I guess when I think about it, balanced forces wouldn't change the ship's velocity at all. Thanks!","You could change the direction the ship is travelling in.","No, no, I'm pretty sure this one is correct. Help me find which idea might be wrong.","Maybe if you increased the amount of force acting on the ship, your velocity could change.","Actually this one is right, I'm pretty sure. But I think one of my other ideas might be wrong. Which one is it?","You could increase or decrease your mass to change the velocity.","Hmm, this must be right though. Increasing and decreasing mass changes how fast the ship is going."
"IF32","Hmm, clearly your mass wasn't right. It should be the same as the sign on the gate. ","The mass gate only lets you pass if your mass is the same as the one posted on the sign! ","I think your ship might have a bit too much or too little mass. But that's just my opinion. ","How can we change the mass of the ship so we can make it through the gate?","We can pick up or drop a Fuzzy pod.","Exactly! Our mass would change if we added a Fuzzy pod or let one go. Nice job!","Our mass could change if we accelerated the ship using a constant force.","Changing acceleration doesn't change mass, though.","We would have less mass if we boosted slower instead of faster.","Your mass won't change if you alter the ship's speed. It stays the same.","The mass may change if we spin the ship. The motion will change the mass.","No, that's not it."
"PRF1","I see what you did there! You're boosting right at the start because you know Newton's 1st Law says you can't start moving unless an unbalanced force acts on the ship. Good one!","Newton's 1st Law says to apply an unbalanced force to something if you want it to start moving. I guess that's why a good boost in the beginning is a great way to get going!","Nice start! Boosting while stationary will apply the unbalanced force needed to get it moving. Newton's 1st Law, of course.","Why are you boosting your ship right at the beginning? ","Newton's 1st Law: The ship will not move unless an unbalanced force acts on it","You got it! Newton's 1st Law says that an object at rest will remain at rest unless an unbalanced force acts on it. (And an object in motion will stay in motion unless an unbalanced force acts on it.)","Newton's 1st Law: An unbalanced force applied perpendicular to the ship's motion will cause it to move diagonally","Close, but not quite. We have to get the ship moving first before we can change its motion. ","Newton's 1st Law: Balanced forces will not change the object's motion","Well, that's true, but you WANT to change your ship's motion so that it will start moving. You need unbalanced forces here! Try again!","Newton's 3rd Law: Colliding with an obstacle rebounds the ship on a new trajectory with the same velocity","Not exactly. We don't need Newton's 3rd Law here because you're not colliding with an obstacle just yet. Try a different law."
"PRF2","Objects will continue moving in the same direction unless an unbalanced force acts on them. Hey, I just realized: the ship is an object too! Guess Newton's 1st Law applies to it as well.","Sometimes your ship is just coasting along with no unbalanced forces acting on it. If that happens, Newton's 1st Law says your ship will just continue in the same direction at the same speed.","It's worth noting that your ship won't stop or change direction unless an unbalanced force acts on it. And that's not just me saying it. That's Newton's 1st Law!","If your ship is moving and there are no unbalanced forces acting on it, what does Newton's 1st Law say will happen?","It will continue in the same direction at the same speed. ","Yep! If there's no force acting on the ship, your speed and direction will stay the same. Velocity is speed and direction. So we can say that our velocity will remain the same (constant velocity).","It will continue in the same direction, but gradually increase in speed","Nope. If there are no unbalanced forces acting on the ship, the speed will not change (and neither will the direction).","Its path will start to curve and it will slow down","Not exactly. If there are no unbalanced forces acting on the ship, then the ship's direction and speed will not change. We call that 'constant velocity' because velocity is speed and direction.","Its path will start to curve, but its speed will stay the same","Try again. If there are no unbalanced forces acting on the ship, then the ship's direction and speed will not change. We call that 'constant velocity' because velocity is speed and direction."
"PRF3","Did you know that your ship won't change direction if the same forces act on it from opposite sides? How weird is that? We call those 'balanced' forces. Newton's 1st Law says that balanced forces don't change the motion of the ship.","Forces on opposite sides of the ship cancel each other out if they are equal. These are called 'balanced' forces. Newton's 1st Law says that balanced forces don't change the ship's motion.","Guess what will happen if you boost up AND down at the same time with the same force? Nothing because the forces are 'balanced'! Isn't Newton's 1st Law weird?","Which part of Newton's 1st Law will help us if we simultaneously boost up AND down at the same time with the same force?","Balanced forces will not change the ship's motion.","Great answer! An up and down boost with the same force will not change the ship's motion. The forces are 'balanced' so there's no change to motion. Netwon's 1st Law.","A force applied perpendicular to the direction of motion will move the ship diagonally.","Keep trying! I don't think an up boost and a down boost are perpendicular to each other. 'Perpendicular' means when one force points sideways into the other one -- Not opposite.","The ship will slow down, stop, or start moving backwards if an unbalanced force is applied in the opposite direction.","Try again. I don't think you're dealing with an unbalanced force in this situation.","The ship won't move unless an unbalanced force acts on it.","Not quite. We're asking about 'balanced' forces. Balanced forces are when the forces opposite one another are equal. Balanced forces cancel each other out."
"PRF4","I noticed you're launching Fuzzies. If you want them to accelerate to higher speeds, consider Newton's 2nd Law and apply more force.","To make your Fuzzy accelerate more when you launch it, apply more force to it. Doing this will send that little guy zooming!","Fuzzies accelerate more if you apply more force to their ship. It's true! I heard it from Newton's 2nd Law.","According to Newton's 2nd Law, if the force used to propel the Fuzzy is increased, what will happen to the pod's acceleration? ","It will increase.","Great answer! Force and acceleration are directly related. When force goes up, so does acceleration.","It will decrease.","Oops! Try again. Think about the relationship between force and acceleration in Newton's 2nd Law. When force goes up, so does acceleration.","It will stay the same.","No, I think acceleration has to change if the force is increased.","It will increase for a moment, then decrease.","Not exactly. Think about the relationship between force and acceleration in Newton's 2nd Law. What happens to acceleration when force increases?"
"PRF5","When you pick up Fuzzies, your mass increases. When your mass increases, you need to apply more force to accelerate the same amount. That's part of Newton's 2nd Law!","According to Newton's 2nd Law, increasing the force will increase the acceleration. Newton's 2nd Law also says that decreasing the fuzzy's mass would increase its acceleration. We can't cut a fuzzy in half though!","Newton's 2nd Law points out that that applying less force casues less acceleration. Launching Fuzzies is a great way to practice this!","If we plan on increasing the speed of the Fuzzy, what does Newton's 2nd Law tell us to do?","Increase the amount of force you apply to the Fuzzy's pod.","Great job! According to Newton's 2nd Law, increasing the force will increase the acceleration. Newton's 2nd Law also says that decreasing the fuzzy's mass would increase its acceleration. We can't cut a fuzzy in half though!","Decrease the acceleration of the Fuzzy's pod.","Nope. Decreasing the acceleration won't cause the fuzzy to go faster. ","Apply an equal boost in the opposite direction of the Fuzzy's direction of travel.","Nope. I think that would slow the fuzzy down, not increase its speed. ","Apply balancing forces on either side of the Fuzzy's pod.","Sorry, try again. Remember, balanced forces don't change the motion of the pod at all."
"PRF6","Boosting with more force will increase your ship's acceleration. You can learn all about it from Newton's 2nd Law.","Acceleration increases as force increases (as long as the mass stays the same). Keep this in mind when setting up the boost parameters with your ship!","If you remember from Newton's 2nd Law, you can apply more force to your ship's boosts to make it go faster. Nifty, huh?","According to Newton's 2nd Law, if the force used to propel the ship is increased, what will happen to the ship's acceleration? ","It will increase.","Yep, you got it! Force and acceleration are directly related. As one increases, so does the other one.","It will decrease.","Oops! Try again. Think about the relationship between force and acceleration in Newton's 2nd Law.","It will stay the same.","No, I think acceleration has to change if the force is increased.","It will increase for a moment, then decrease.","Not exactly. Think about the relationship between force and acceleration in Newton's 2nd Law. What happens to acceleration when force increases?"
"PRF7","Picking up Fuzzies adds mass to your ship. This extra weight will slow the ship down, requiring more force to go the same distance.","Acceleration decreases as mass increases (when the force stays the same). What does this mean for you? It means your ship is going to be heavier and slower after picking up a Fuzzy!","When you pick up a Fuzzy pod, your ship requires more force to push it the same distance as before. This is because your mass has increased.","If the Fuzzy's pod gains mass while it's traveling, what will happen to its acceleration if the force stays the same?","It will decrease.","Great answer! If force doesn't change, then acceleration will decrease when mass increases. ","It will gradually increase.","Nope. Think about Newton's 2nd Law. That will tell you the relationship between force, mass and acceleration.","The pod will stop moving.","No, try again. As long as there is an unbalanced force acting on the pod, it will not stop moving.","It will increase at first, then decrease.","Not exactly. Think about the relationship between force, mass and acceleration in Newton's 2nd Law. What happens to acceleration when mass increases (and the force doesn't change)?"
"PRF8","Fuzzy pods that are dropped will keep on going in the same direction they were dropped in, and at the same speed too!","Once a Fuzzy is dropped from your ship, Newton's 1st Law takes over. The pod will move at a constant speed and not change its direction unless other forces act on it.","Fuzzy pods move in the same direction and at the same speed unless forces are applied to them. This knowledge can be extremely useful when deciding how to drop their pods!","What kind of motion do you think the Fuzzy pod will have after you drop it from your ship?","It will continue travelling in the same direction at a constant speed until a force acts on it.","Yes! That's Newton's 1st Law in action!","The Fuzzy will gradually slow down until it stops.","Not quite. In order for it to slow down, there would have to be some kind of force acting on the pod in the opposite direction of travel.","The pod will start accelerating faster and faster.","Nope, not this time. Remember that there are no forces acting on the fuzzy pod once you drop it from your ship.","The Fuzzy will start to curve in one direction.","Keep trying! In order for the fuzzy pod to curve like that, there would have to be a constant force acting on the pod. I don't think that's happening here."
"PRF9","Ah, I see you're carrying Fuzzies here. Make sure you use larger forces to move around after adding them to your ship!","Fuzzy pods add mass to your ship and require you to use bigger forces to move the same distances you did before. Nice work!","That's pretty cool that you actually change your boost forces after picking up Fuzzies. It takes more force to move now. Let's watch what happens.","What affect will picking up that Fuzzy have on the forces you use to push around your ship?","I have to use larger forces to move the same distances I could before.","You bet! More mass requires more force to accelerate the same amount.","The forces actually don't change. Because we're in space, mass doesn't matter.","Not exactly. You may feel weightless in space, but your mass is still the same. Try again.","I have to use smaller forces to move the same distances I could before.","Hm, that doesn't sound right to me. Wouldn't you require MORE force to move more mass the same distance?","I'll have to Boost more often now because my ship will start coming to a stop if I don't apply more forces. All that extra mass makes us slow down after every boost.","You're on the right track. The ship's mass definitely affects your motion, but you won't slowly come to a stop because of it. Think back to Newton's 1st Law."
"POF1","You need forces to make your ship move from a stationary position. Newton's 1st Law handles this nicely.","I like how you use a nice strong Rocket Boost to get your ship moving at the start. It would just stay there if no forces were applied! That's Newton's 1st Law!","Force is what causes objects to move around. The Rocket Boosts you use can apply unbalanced forces that push you around space.","What was the point of boosting your ship right at the start? ","Newton's 1st Law: The ship will not move unless a force acts on it","You got it! You need Newton's 1st Law to start the ship's motion.","Newton's 1st Law: A force applied perpendicular to the ship's motion will cause it to move diagonally","Close, but not quite.

"POF2","Once your ship started moving, it just kept going! Newton's 1st Law explains why: you can only make your ship stop or move by applying forces.","As Newton's 1st Law states, you will continue to move along in the same direction at a constant speed if there are no other forces acting on you.","Ships on the move won't stop unless they bump into something or fire a rocket. It's true! I learned that from Newton's 1st Law.","What does Newton's 1st Law say will happen if your ship is moving but there is no force acting on it?","It will continue in the same direction at a constant speed","Yep! If there's no force acting on the ship, your speed and direction will stay the same.","It will continue in the same direction, but gradually increase in speed","Nope.

The speed will stay the same, but the direction will NOT change unless there are forces acting on the ship."
"POF3","Isn't this neat? If you boost in opposite directions with the same force, nothing will happen! The forces balance each other out.","We know that with Newton's 1st Law, balanced forces don't change the ship's motion at all. So any time we boost in opposite directions with the same force at the same time, nothing will happen!","If you boost in opposite directions with the same force, what do you get? Balanced forces! Or as I like to call it, a Newton's Sandwich.","Which part of Newton's 1st Law helps us if we simultaneously boost up AND down at the same time with the same force?","Balanced forces will not change the ship's motion.","Great answer!
